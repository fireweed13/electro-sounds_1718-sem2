# Assignment A

_For this assignment, we were tasked to replicate drawings from 3 different visual artists : Ryoji Ikeda, Sol Lewitt, Freider Nake. These vary from black and white lines, to coloured boxes and circles and what not. Then we took it one step further and animated the sketches. In the archive folder you will find the non-animated sketch, whereas in the final folder is the animated one_.
